# DrawWithMe

This project is a Figma clone trying build a collaborative environment where multiple users can work together on a canvas with real-world features such as live collaboration, comments, reactions, and drawing designs. 
A hands-on project for me to practice with new emerging technologies while getting to mess with LiveBlocks



## Tech Stack

- **Next.js**: A React framework for building server-side rendered applications.
- **TypeScript**: A statically typed superset of JavaScript that enhances code quality and developer productivity.
- **Liveblocks**: A real-time collaboration SDK used to enable live collaboration features.
- **Fabric.js**: A JavaScript library that provides an interactive object model for canvas elements.
- **Shadcn**: A library for handling real-time cursor synchronization and chat.
- **Tailwind CSS**: A utility-first CSS framework for building custom designs quickly.
